## 📋 Overview

This repository contains forensic artifacts and indicators for Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools commonly observed in threat actor operations. These cheat sheets are compiled from hands-on research in controlled lab environments to support defensive security operations.

## 🎯 Purpose

Remote Monitoring and Management tools have become increasingly popular in both legitimate IT operations and malicious campaigns. Threat actors frequently leverage RMM tools for:

- Initial access and persistence
- Command and control (C2) communications
- Lateral movement
- Data exfiltration
- Ransomware deployment

This collection aims to help blue teams identify, investigate, and respond to suspicious RMM tool usage in their environments.
